# WIKIBLOG
### Personal blog project

## **Updates** ##

**September 2020** - I wasn't satisfied with the content and structure of the blog, so I decided to
work on a new design and UI/X to make sure everything feels easy to read and catch up but also add a 
social dimension to the whole experience. It's still on progress but the design of the homepage has 
changed. You can have a glimpse at it here:

is in progress. Custom hooks have been added as well to have an easier integration.
